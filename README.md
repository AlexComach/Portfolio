# Website Portfolio
I made this website portfolio so that I can showcase work that I'm doing and will be doing in the future. You can use it to contact me via email or contact form, my resume and fun features implemented
with Javascript.

## How it's made
**Tech used** HTML, CSS and JavaScript
This is my first ever project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so I decided to make the design simple but clean. I used a lot of flexboxes and Grids for formatting the CSS. I also have coloured
important words in a bluey colour, and for important buttons I've made stand out button in the same blue button colour with white text. I've also included smoothing scrolling between pages, dark mode
and light mode, which I used 2 separate CSS style sheets for, and the resume section which allows you to either view the resume within the portfolio or download it as a PDF file. The contact form uses a tool
called web3forms, which sends the inputs in the form to my email address.

## Lessons learned:
My first every web dev project after learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript really helped me catapult my understanding of the technologies and programming in general. I have become vastly more comfortable with
everything compared to before starting the project. In particular, for CSS, it has helped me understand how to manipulate CSS flexboxes and grids more effectively, and for JavaScript, it has helped me understand
how DOM works on a more deeper level and also deepened my understanding the concepts of OOP in programming. 

## Aspirations for this project:
I would like to learn react or another front end framework so I can make my portfolio more interactive with cool features
